TODO CreativeUserApp
=====================

0) Setup environment and confirm everything is working.

1) Create application framework (rough draft) and confirm application is starting and showing.

2) Design and implement data model.
-create SQLite database and confirm it is working
-considerations on datatypes and the limitations of SQLite (no DATE column type for timestamp, use integer?)
-should we have referential integrity between user and session?

3) Design and implement user views and flow.
-login view, list sessions view
-should we register on the fly or have a separate register view?

4) Design and implement authentication
-should we store password in clear text or hash it? possibly even salt it.
-should we check if user exist and inform thusly, or simply say "password incorrect" as is most often the case
-log user session in db upon successful login or every login attempt?

5) Design and implement bonus features if there is time
-calculate and inform user of password strength upon user creation
-restore password feature
-lock user after X consecutive failed login attempts
-superuser who can view and edit locked users
-gesture authentication instead of password (probably outside the scope of this project)
-settings view, with settings for the number of last sessions which should be displayed

6) Implement localization for applicable languages (English and Swedish for the first version).

7) Tweak design and graphical elements if there is time.
