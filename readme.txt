Hi Tobias,

 
Please find the work test instructions below. 

We don't give much more guidance than this, we let you use your imagination and creativity to come up with something to impress us..


Task:
 

Create an Android application based upon persistent storage (perhaps a database). The application should allow a person to:

1. register

2. authenticate herself

3. Access a view where a list of timestamps for the user's last 5 successful login attempts is shown. Only authorized persons should be able to access this view.
 

Prerequisites:

- You will walk us through your solution when we meet

- We should be able to test your solution when we meet

 

Please present your results in the meeting we have scheduled for Friday @ 09.00.


Good Luck!
